UNION

The UNION operator is used to combine the result-sets of two or more SELECT statements.

All SELECT statements within the UNION must have the same number of columns.
The columns must also have the same data types.
Also, the columns in each SELECT statement must be in the same order.


The syntax of UNION is as follows:
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;



TIP:
If your columns don't match exactly across all queries, you can use a NULL (or any other) value such as:

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Company FROM businessContacts
UNION
SELECT FirstName, LastName, NULL FROM otherContacts;



UNION ALL

UNION ALL selects all rows from each table and combines them into a single table.
the result set includes any duplicate rows as well.






Inserting Data

SQL tables store data in rows, one row after another. The INSERT INTO statement is used to add new rows of data to a table in the database.
The SQL INSERT INTO syntax is as follows:
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3,...);

Make sure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table.

Use the following SQL statement to insert a new row:
INSERT INTO Employees
VALUES (8, 'Anthony', 'Young', 35);

When inserting records into a table using the SQL INSERT statement, you must provide a value for every column that does not have a default value, or does not support NULL.


Alternatively, you can specify the table's column names in the INSERT INTO statement:
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...,columnN)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3,...valueN);

column1, column2, ..., columnN are the names of the columns that you want to insert data into.
INSERT INTO Employees (ID, FirstName, LastName, Age)
VALUES (8, 'Anthony', 'Young', 35);

You can specify your own column order, as long as the values are specified in the same order as the columns.


It is also possible to insert data into specific columns only.
INSERT INTO Employees (ID, FirstName, LastName)
VALUES (9, 'Samuel', 'Clark');

The fourth column, "Age" for that row automatically became 0, as that is its default value.
