UNION

The UNION operator is used to combine the result-sets of two or more SELECT statements.

All SELECT statements within the UNION must have the same number of columns. The columns must also have the same data types. Also, the columns in each SELECT statement must be in the same order.
The syntax of UNION is as follows:
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;



TIP:
If your columns don't match exactly across all queries, you can use a NULL (or any other) value such as:
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Company FROM businessContacts
UNION
SELECT FirstName, LastName, NULL FROM otherContacts;
