Updating Data

The UPDATE statement allows us to alter data in the table.

The basic syntax of an UPDATE query with a WHERE clause is as follows:
UPDATE table_name
SET column1=value1, column2=value2, ...
WHERE condition;

You specify the column and its new value in a comma-separated list after the SET keyword.


!!!   IMPORTANT NOTE:  !!!
If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be updated!


Example with table Employees with columns: ID, Name, Salary

To update John's salary, we can use the following query:

UPDATE Employees
SET Salary=5000
WHERE ID=1;


It is also possible to UPDATE multiple columns at the same time by comma-separating them:

UPDATE Employees
SET Salary=5000, FirstName='Robert'
WHERE ID=1;

You can specify the column order any way you like in the SET clause.





Deleting Data

The DELETE statement is used to remove data from your table. DELETE queries work much like UPDATE queries.
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

For example, you can delete a specific employee from the table:
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE ID=1;


!!!   IMPORTANT NOTE:  !!!
If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be deleted!
The DELETE statement removes the data from the table permanently.
