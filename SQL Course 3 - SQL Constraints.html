SQL Constraints

SQL constraints are used to specify rules for table data.

The following are commonly used SQL constraints:
NOT NULL - Indicates that a column cannot contain any NULL value.
UNIQUE - Does not allow to insert a duplicate value in a column. The UNIQUE constraint maintains the uniqueness of a column in a table. More than one UNIQUE column can be used in a table.
PRIMARY KEY - Enforces the table to accept unique data for a specific column and this constraint create a unique index for accessing the table faster.
CHECK - Determines whether the value is valid or not from a logical expression.
DEFAULT - While inserting data into a table, if no value is supplied to a column, then the column gets the value set as DEFAULT.

For example, the following means that the name column disallows NULL values.
name varchar(100) NOT NULL

During table creation, specify column level constraint(s) after the data type of that column.



EXAMPLE: Fill in the missing parts so that the column ''username'' disallows empty values.

username varchar (50)
NOT  NULL




AUTO INCREMENT

Auto-increment allows a unique number to be generated when a new record is inserted into a table.

Often, we would like the value of the primary key field to be created automatically every time a new record is inserted.

By default, the starting value for AUTO_INCREMENT is 1, and it will increment by 1 for each new record.
Let's set the UserID field to be a primary key that automatically generates a new value:
UserID int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
PRIMARY KEY (UserID)


So When inserting a new record into the Users table, it's not necessary to specify a value for the id column;
a unique new value will be added automatically.


example below demonstrates how to create a table using constraints.
CREATE TABLE Users (
id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
username varchar(40) NOT NULL,
password varchar(10) NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY(id)
);

The following SQL enforces that the "id", "username", and "password" columns do not accept NULL values.
We also define the "id" column to be an auto-increment primary key field.




ALTER TABLE

The ALTER TABLE command is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.
You would also use the ALTER TABLE command to add and drop various constraints on an existing table.

EXAMPLE:  The following SQL code adds a new column named DateOfBirth:

ALTER TABLE People ADD DateOfBirth date;

All rows will have the default value in the newly added column, which, in this case, is NULL.




Dropping

The following SQL code demonstrates how to delete the column named DateOfBirth in the People table.
ALTER TABLE People
DROP COLUMN DateOfBirth;


The column, along with all of its data, will be completely removed from the table.

To delete the entire table, use the DROP TABLE command:
DROP TABLE People;




Renaming

The ALTER TABLE command is also used to rename columns:
This query will rename the column called "FirstName" to "name":

ALTER TABLE People
CHANGE FirstName name varchar(100);



Renaming Tables

You can rename the entire table using the RENAME command:
RENAME TABLE People TO Users;

This will rename the table People to Users.
