Views

In SQL, a VIEW is a virtual table that is based on the result-set of an SQL statement.

A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table.
The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.

Views allow us to:
- Structure data in a way that users or classes of users find natural or intuitive.
- Restrict access to the data in such a way that a user can see
and (sometimes) modify exactly what they need and no more.
- Summarize data from various tables and use it to generate reports.

To create a view:
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

The SELECT query can be as complex as you need it to be. It can contain multiple JOINS and other commands.





EXAMPLE:
To create a view that displays each employee's FirstName and Salary.
CREATE VIEW List AS
SELECT FirstName, Salary
FROM  Employees;

Now, you can query the List view as you would query an actual table.
SELECT * FROM List;



A view always shows up-to-date data!
The database engine uses the view's SQL statement to recreate the data each time a user queries a view.



EXAMPLE: to create a view named ''temp'' for students with the highest marks:

CREATE VIEW  temp AS
SELECT id, name, mark
FROM students
ORDER BY  mark DESC
LIMIT 10;




Updating a View

You can update a view by using the following syntax:
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

The example below updates our List view to select also the LastName:

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW List AS
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary
FROM  Employees;


You can delete a view with the DROP VIEW command.
DROP VIEW List;
